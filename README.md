# Project Overview

## Project Structure

The project consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files organized to create a responsive website with interactive elements. Here's an overview of the structure:

- **HTML Files:**
  - The main HTML file (`index.html`) likely contains the structure of the entire website, including sections like header, main content, footer, etc.
  
- **CSS Files:**
  - The CSS styles are organized in a single file (`styles.css`). 
  - It contains styles for different sections of the website, including the header, sections, navbar, footer, and more.
  
- **JavaScript Files:**
  - The JavaScript functionality is divided into different sections:
    - Handling questions section interactions.
    - Implementing carousel functionality.
    - Managing header scrolling behavior.
    - Handling navbar toggle functionality.
  - These functionalities are likely contained in a single JavaScript file (`script.js`).

## Methods/Tools Used and Why

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:**
  - Standard web development languages used to create the structure, style, and interactivity of the website.

- **Flexbox/Grid Layout:**
  - Used in CSS to create responsive and flexible layouts for different sections of the website.
- **DOM Manipulation:**
  - JavaScript interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update content and manage user interactions.

  - Utilized for smooth animations and transitions when elements change state or position.
